well hopefully youve extracted this right
you should have the following files

------- news (folder)
--------------- images (sub dir)
----------- readme
----------- news.php
----------- conf.php // edit this one
----------- installerp.php
----------- header.php
----------- footer.php
----------- connect.inc
----------- admin.php
----------- login.php

so when you upload you show caled a folder called "news" with everything in there






..............editing conf.php.....................
...................................................

I think the only one i need to explain is '$cook'
cook is your cookie domain ie..
.evobb.com // this would cover everything below '/'

so if you were hosted by f2s.com and have a subdomain
you would set the following '.yourdomain.f2s.com'
or if you had a http://www.somplace.com/~yourplace/
you would set the following '.someplace.com'

If you have any problems mess around with it. 
And if All else fails contact me 
neiller@evobb.com

surf to http://yourdomain/whereever/installer.php
once installed and youve seen all green ticks 
(note if you see red ticks something is wrong with your details)
go to login.php

username = webmaster
password = password






..........Get the news on my index page...........
..................................................
