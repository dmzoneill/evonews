  says:
hehe
Kris says:

Kris says:
if ($loggedin){ loggedinshit here} else {not logged in}
Kris says:

  says:
http://www.xdweb.net/~neiller/admin.php
Kris says:

Kris says:
lol, looks nice
Kris says:
it will be cool man
Kris says:
when you get it working that is
  says:
lmfao
  says:
i hate cookies
  says:
how does evos tracking sytem work ? sessions or ip addys?
Kris says:
yeah
Kris says:
they suck sometimes
Kris says:
evo's tracking works like this
Kris says:
it has a table that has a browsingid column
Kris says:
when you surf to evo it gets your browsingid
Kris says:
which is
Kris says:
your
Kris says:
hostname
Kris says:
+ you
Kris says:
r
Kris says:
browser/version/os/version
Kris says:
md5 hashes
Kris says:
d
Kris says:
hashed
Kris says:
so fi you want to see look in the 'browsing' table and you will see lots of
Kris says:
sdffsd8768sdf8sdf98sfdg9876kl;j43
Kris says:
shit liek that
Kris says:
that is what identifies you
Kris says:
from the rest of the net
Kris says:
and since it runs off hostname and user agent/os and shit
Kris says:
it cant really be faked
  says:
mm but i dont need anything as compilcated as that
Kris says:
cause if someones hostname was faked, it would send the info back to the wrong person
  says:
all i need really is?
  says:
lol gimmme something simple to work on
Kris says:
ok
Kris says:
are you in the database?
  says:
yes
Kris says:
ok
Kris says:
make a table called
Kris says:
news_sessions
Kris says:
with 3 columns
Kris says:
first column
Kris says:
called
Kris says:
browsingid
varchar 40
Kris says:
second called
Kris says:
username varchar
Kris says:
20
Kris says:
third called loggedin tinyint 1
Kris says:
then
  says:
im with yeah lol
Kris says:
ok
  says:
done
Kris says:
make a file called news_track.php
Kris says:
and in it
Kris says:
put this
Kris says:
<?php
$browsingid = md5(getenv('REMOTE_ADDR').getenv('USER_AGENT'));
Kris says:
then
Kris says:
connect to mysql
Kris says:
and do:
select * from news_sessions where browsingid = '$browsingid'
Kris says:
then do an if then statement like this:
if (mysql_num_rows($result)<1){
mysql: insert into news_sessions (browsingid, username, loggedin) values ('$browsingid', 'guest', '0')
}
Kris says:
that basically says: if this person doesnt have an entry in the sessions table then give them one
Kris says:
then do an if then statement like this
  says:
i understand
Kris says:
$result = mysql_query("select * from news_sessions where browsingid = '$browsingid && loggedin = '1''", $db);

if (mysql_num_rows($result)>0){
$loggedin = "yes";
$username = mysql_result($result, 0, 1);
} else {
unset($loggedin);
}
Kris says:
oops, i forgot a ' after $browsingid
Kris says:
that last statement checks to see if they are logged in
Kris says:
now
Kris says:
all you need to do is include('news_track.php'); at the top of any file
Kris says:
then
Kris says:
do
Kris says:
if ($loggedin){
file stuff here
} else {
print login box
}
Kris says:
and when someone successfully logs in
Kris says:
instead of setting a cookie
Kris says:
you just need to do
Kris says:
mysql: update news_sessions set loggedin = '1', username = '$username' where browsingid = '$browsingid'
Kris says:
the var $username will also be the username of the person that is logged in
  says:
mmm, ye must have been cracking up writing your version of that with evobb
  says:
lmao
Kris says:
what do you mean by cracking up?
  says:
thanx though, im definatley going this way
Kris says:
np
  says:
cracking up = going insane lol
Kris says:
lol
Kris says:
there were some times....
Kris says:
hehe
